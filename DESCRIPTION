Description: Implements continuous-time hidden Markov models to infer
    identity-by-descent (IBD) segments shared by two individuals from
    their SNP genotypes. Provides posterior probabilities at each marker
    (forward-backward), prediction of IBD segments (Viterbi), and
    functions for visualising results. Supports both autosomes and the X
    chromosome.
